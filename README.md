# chair-with-commitment-issues
Built by Sarah Whelan, Dana Zagar, and Tyler Lacroix in March 2017.

Modelled for a smart chair, to gently remind the person sitting to stand up at set intervals. 
While they are sitting, the chair monitors posture. Posture was modelled using a potentiometer 
and the person's weight was modelled with a temperature sensor.

Built using Assembly language on the HC12 microcontroller for the ECE 3375 Microprocessors & Microcontrollers design project.
